** TODO Implement `equal' form.
*** State
    Equal operator for numbers is implemented. One for the `string' type
    is needed.

    The next stage will be the implementation of the `equal' to expose those operators
    to the lisp side.

** TODO Tue Apr 19 09:02:16 2011 (Default forms.)
   Make this default forms customizable through variables or something.

   What I'm talkin' about is this ugly default form list in `src/lisp.cpp'
   This should be customizable through the user. Maybe by implementing this list
   as vector so that the user can add his forms easily by using a function
   (which must be implemented too).
